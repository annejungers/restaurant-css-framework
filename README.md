* Menu page (with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges)
* Pictures page (with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page)
* Restaurant page (A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.)
* Contact page (A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon.)
